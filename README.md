# Cordis

## An application inspired by Discord, enabling users to communicate easily and conveniently within groups and thematic channels. The key features of the application include:

1. Creating your own servers – Users will be able to create their own servers, where they will have full administrative privileges, including the ability to manage channels and users.

2. Text channels – On each server, users will be able to create text channels to organize discussions on various topics.

3. Invitation system – Access to servers will be possible through invitations generated by administrators.

4. Private messages – Users will be able to send direct messages to their friends within the application, enabling communication outside of servers.

5. Joining servers and participating in channels – Users will be able to join servers using invitations and then actively participate in conversations on specific text channels by posting messages and engaging in discussions according to the channel's theme.

## Technology
The project will be developed using Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend, ensuring a robust and scalable architecture. The system will utilize a PostgreSQL database, which will be containerized and managed within a Docker environment for consistency and ease of deployment. Real-time communication features, such as chat functionality, will be implemented using WebSockets with the STOMP protocol to enable efficient and seamless messaging between users.

To ensure the reliability and quality of the codebase, the application will be thoroughly tested using JUnit 5 for unit testing, Mockito for mocking dependencies, and JaCoCo for code coverage analysis.
